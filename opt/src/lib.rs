//! Draconian's optimisation passes, and the machinery that runs them on many
//! functions at once.
//!
//! - `ctx` and `par`: splitting a module so threads can work on different
//!   functions, and scheduling the work.
//! - `callgraph`: the call graph, its cycles (SCCs) and the bottom-up order.
//! - `inline`: the inliner and its cost model.
//! - `recursion`: turning recursion into loops with an explicit stack.
//! - `pipeline`: the passes above, run together.
//! - `combine`: rewriting instructions into simpler ones, from rules in
//!   `opt/rules/combine.rules`, matched with a discrimination tree.
//! - `aa`: basic alias analysis: whether two accesses can overlap, and
//!   whether an instruction can read or write a location.
//! - `sroa`: splitting allocas into pieces `mem2reg` can promote.
//! - `mem2reg`: promoting allocas to SSA values.
//! - `memssa`: memory SSA, and the walker that finds a load's clobbering
//!   write on demand.
//! - `simplifycfg`: unreachable blocks, empty blocks, diamonds to
//!   selects, straight lines; branches themselves fold in the combiner.
//! - `cse`: common-subexpression elimination, by hashing a canonical key
//!   for each instruction, scoped by the dominator tree.
//! - `cfg`, `ssa`, `cleanup`: analyses and helpers the passes share.
//!
//! See `docs/design/parallel.md` for the design.
