# Code generation

This document covers how Draconian turns IR into machine code. For sources and
status labels, see the [index](README.md).

The code generator documentation marks several parts as "To Be Written". Those
parts are marked **Open** here, and Draconian designs them itself.

## 1. Phases

The code generator runs these phases in order:

1. **Instruction selection**: turns IR into target instructions that use
   virtual registers in SSA form.
2. **Scheduling and formation**: puts the selected instructions in order and
   builds machine instructions.
3. **SSA machine code optimisations**: optional. **Open**, not described in
   the documentation.
4. **Register allocation**: maps virtual registers to physical ones and adds
   spill code.
5. **Prologue and epilogue insertion**: builds the stack frame and replaces
   abstract stack references with real offsets. **Open**, not described.
6. **Late machine code optimisations**: **Open**, not described.
7. **Code emission**: writes assembly text or an object file.

IR passes `codegenprepare`, `lower-switch`, `lower-invoke` and
`break-crit-edges` (see [ir.md](ir.md)) run before phase 1.

## 2. Machine code data structures

| Structure | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Machine function | One per IR function. Holds its blocks, constant pool, frame info, target-specific info and register info. |
| Machine basic block | A list of machine instructions. One IR block can become several machine blocks. |
| Machine instruction | An opcode and operands. Operands that define values come first. |
| Bundle | A group of instructions under a `BUNDLE` header, with each member flagged as inside it. Used for VLIW packets and Thumb2 `IT` blocks. |
| Register info | Tracks virtual registers, their classes and, for GlobalISel, their types. |
| Register mask operand | Lists the registers a call clobbers. |

### Target description

A target provides these pieces. Only the target machine and data layout are
required.

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Target machine | Entry point. Gives access to every other piece. |
| Data layout | Type sizes, alignment, endianness and pointer size. |
| Lowering | How IR operations and calls map onto the target. |
| Register info | Registers, register classes and aliases. |
| Instruction info | Instructions, plus helpers such as copying, spilling and analysing branches. |
| Frame lowering | Stack layout, prologue and epilogue. |
| Subtarget | CPU and feature flags, from `-mcpu=` and `-mattr=`. |
| Calling convention | Where arguments and return values go. Draconian describes conventions as named metadata in the target description; see [isel](isel.md#calling-conventions). |
| Assembly printer | Turns machine instructions into text or MC instructions. |

LLVM describes most of this in TableGen files. Draconian describes targets in
LLVM IR instead: each instruction is a function whose body says what it does,
with its encoding and assembly in attributes, read as data at start-up. See
[machine descriptions and instruction selection](isel.md).

## 3. Instruction selection

Draconian will have both selectors, as LLVM does. SelectionDAG comes first
because it is the most fully documented.

### SelectionDAG

The DAG is made of nodes connected by value edges. Value edges carry types.
Chain edges, of type `Other`, keep side effects in order.

Phases, in order:

1. **Build**: translate IR into a naive DAG.
2. **Combine**: simplify the DAG.
3. **Legalise types**: promote or expand types the target lacks. Vectors can
   also be widened, split or scalarised.
4. **Combine** again.
5. **Legalise operations**: expand, promote or custom-lower operations the
   target lacks.
6. **Combine** again.
7. **Select**: match DAG patterns to target instructions.
8. **Schedule**: put the DAG in a line and emit machine instructions.

The combiner runs after the build and after each legalisation step.

### GlobalISel

GlobalISel works on generic machine IR (gMIR). gMIR uses the same structures
as machine IR but with looser rules: a virtual register can have a type
without a register class. Types are kept in a table that is dropped after
selection.

| Pass | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IRTranslator | Translates IR into gMIR. | Later |
| Legalizer | Replaces operations the target lacks with ones it has. | Later |
| RegBankSelect | Puts each virtual register in a register bank, grouping code to avoid copies between banks. | Later |
| InstructionSelect | Selects target instructions. No gMIR may remain afterwards. | Later |
| Combiner | Optional. Replaces instruction patterns with better ones. | Later |

**Open:** the details of generic opcodes, low-level types and the known-bits
analysis are on GlobalISel subpages we have not read yet.

## 4. Register allocation

### Before allocation

| Pass | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live variables | Finds where each register is killed or dead. Uses SSA for virtual registers and tracks physical registers within a block. | Planned |
| PHI elimination | Replaces PHI instructions with copies. Copies go at the end of each predecessor, through temporaries; see [isel](isel.md). | Done |
| Two-address | Rewrites three-address instructions into two-address form where the target needs it. | Planned |
| Live intervals | Numbers instructions and builds a live range for each virtual register. The documentation is incomplete here. Draconian keeps one segment per block; see [isel](isel.md). | Done |

### Allocators

Chosen with `-regalloc=`.

| Allocator | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fast` | Works one block at a time. The default for debug builds. | Planned |
| `basic` | Allocates live ranges one by one in a heuristic order. Useful for finding bugs. | Planned |
| linear scan | Draconian's first allocator: live ranges in order of start, copy hints, callee-saved registers for values live across calls, spills through scratch registers. See [isel](isel.md). | Done |
| `greedy` | The default. Like `basic`, plus splitting live ranges across the function. | Later |
| `pbqp` | Solves allocation as a partitioned boolean quadratic problem. | Later |

### Allocation support

- **Pre-coloured registers**: physical registers already in the code, either
  as operands or as implicit uses and definitions.
- **Rewriting**: either change operands directly, or record a
  virtual-to-physical map and let a spiller rewrite the code.
- **Spiller**: adds loads and stores for spilled registers.
- **Folding**: folds a spill load or store into the instruction that uses it,
  to remove copies.

## 5. Machine passes after selection

The documentation names only a few of these. **Open:** the rest of the
pipeline is ours to design.

| Pass | Source | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Branch folder | Writing an LLVM Backend | Merges and simplifies branches using the target's branch analysis. Draconian skips blocks that only branch and drops branches to the next block. | Partial |
| If-converter | Writing an LLVM Backend | Turns branches into predicated instructions using branch analysis. | Later |
| VLIW packetiser | Code generator | Groups instructions into packets using a resource state machine. | Later |
| Tail call optimisation | Code generator | Guaranteed tail calls for `fastcc`, `tailcc`, or with `-tailcallopt`. | Later |
| Sibling call optimisation | Code generator | A narrower tail call that needs no flag, when conventions and stack arguments allow. | Planned |

Targets can add passes at fixed points in the pipeline. The documented hooks
are "add instruction selector" and "add before emission".

## 6. Code emission (MC layer)

| Piece | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Streamer | An assembler-like interface with one method per directive. It writes either a `.s` file or a `.o` file. Targets can add their own directives. |
| Context | Owns symbols and sections and makes sure each exists once. |
| Symbol | A label. Temporary labels are dropped from object files. |
| Section | An object-format section: ELF, Mach-O or COFF. |
| MC instruction | An opcode plus operands. Each operand is an immediate, a register or an expression. |
| Expression | A symbolic value used as an operand. |

To emit code, a target needs:

- An assembly printer.
- An instruction printer.
- Lowering from machine instructions to MC instructions. This also expands
  pseudo-instructions.
- An encoder, which turns MC instructions into bytes and relocations. Only
  needed for object files.

The assembler matches mnemonic aliases first, then instruction aliases.

### Optional sections

| Flag | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| `-stack-size-section` | Pairs of function symbol and stack size. Only counts the prologue, and leaves out functions with dynamic stack allocations. |
| `--call-graph-section` | Call graph information. The layout has its own document. |

## 7. Targets

**Open:** which target comes first. The suggestion is AArch64 or RISC-V,
because their encodings are regular and they are well documented by their
vendors. x86-64 should follow.

The code generator documentation also has notes on X86, PowerPC, NVPTX, eBPF
and AMDGPU, including x86-64 compact unwind encoding. These get their own
documents when we reach those targets.

## 8. Debugging options

These options show the DAG at each step. Draconian should support them as text
or `.dot` output: `-view-dag-combine1-dags`, `-view-legalize-dags`,
`-view-dag-combine2-dags`, `-view-isel-dags`, `-view-sched-dags`,
`-view-sunit-dags` and `-filter-view-dags`. `-debug-only=isel` and
`-filter-print-funcs=` control text dumps.

## 9. Build order

1. Machine IR data structures and a text printer for them.
2. A first target description: registers, instructions and calling
   convention.
3. SelectionDAG: build, then select, for already-legal code only.
4. Scheduling in source order.
5. PHI elimination, two-address, then the `fast` allocator.
6. Prologue and epilogue, then assembly output.
7. Type and operation legalisation, and the DAG combiner.
8. Live intervals, then `basic`, then `greedy`.
9. Object file output.
10. GlobalISel.
